  aboutText: [`Hi, my name is Simanga Hendry Khoza but you can call me Hendrick, I'm from Mpumalanga in the north side of South Africa. I was studying computer system engineering at Tshwane University of Technology, currently I am looking for internship program as part of my curriculum in order to obtain my national diploma.`, `During school I learn various of skills such as Database Design, System Design, Industrial Intelligent to name a few and on my spare time I taught myself web development and graphic design. When I'm not studying towards my schoolwork, I spend a lot of my time at the gym, searching for funny memes on the Internet or solving real life problems`, `My biggest motivation comes from knowing how big the universe is, and throughout our humanity exploring the universe, we have yet to discover an element that isnâ€™t within our body, perhaps we are not living in the universe but the universe lives within us.`],
